Ember is a movie searching app that allows users to find information
about movies, where to watch, and for what price.  After launching
the app, you will see a search button at the top, your movie history
in the middle, a load history button at the bottom and the next and previous
buttons at the very bottom.  The search button will take you to the search
page.  Select the grey bar to bring up the keyboard.  There is a ticker just
below the grey bar that allows you to toggle searching by title or searching
by actor.  Select which of those you would like to search for.  After typing
your query, click the search button.  You have the option to scroll pages
with the next and prev buttons, you have the add filters button, in which
you can add filters,and with the next and previous buttons, and once
you select a tile, you will be brought to the movie information page.
This page has two buttons on it, the back will take you back to your
search results, and the view suggested movies will show you movies that
are related by genre to the movie you selected.  If you back all the way
to the original page, you will see every movie you have clicked in the
current session. If you click any of the tiles on this page, it will take you
back to that movie page.  The reset button on the search page allows you to
remove any filters you have added.
